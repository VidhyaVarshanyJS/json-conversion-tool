# JSON-CSV-TOOL
## Description
Provides functions for converting JSON objects to and from CSVs.

## Contributing
- Clone the repo and run `npm install`.
- Create a new feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-branch-name`.
- Write a test in the `__tests__` folder for your feature.
- Write the code to get the test passing, running `npm run test`.
- Push your branch up and submit a pull request.

Note: I have configured a launch.json for vscode that should allow for playing around with anything in index.ts and hitting f5 to debug.

## Publishing
